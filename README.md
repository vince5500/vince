## Unique Design Choices & Creativity 🎨

### Niche & Influence 🎯

Targeting tech enthusiasts and gamers, the design blends sophistication with comfort through a dark theme and modern UI patterns.

### Color Palette 🎨

- **Primary:** Dark Purple (#7F5AF0) — vibrant yet professional  
- **Background:** Deep Charcoal (#121212) — eye-friendly and stylish  
- **Accent & Surface:** Shades of purple and gray for depth  
- **Text:** Whites and muted whites for clarity and hierarchy

### Typography & Iconography ✍️

- **Fonts:** Poppins for headlines (bold, modern), Roboto for body (clean, readable)  
- **Icons:** Consistent material icons for clarity

### Innovative UI/UX Features 💡

- Parallax effects on product carousel for immersive browsing  
- Reusable widgets for consistency & maintainability  
- Interactive elements like pinch-zoom and animated selectors  
- Personalized touches like “Welcome back” message and “Recently Viewed”

## Challenges Faced & Solutions 🛠️

### Challenge 1: Smooth Parallax Animation

- **Issue:** Creating natural card scaling and movement on horizontal scroll was tricky.  
- **Solution:** Used `PageController.page` to track scroll position and scale cards; added subtle image movement inside cards for layered parallax.

### Challenge 2: Consistent Quantity Control

- **Issue:** Multiple quantity controls caused inconsistent UI and complex state handling.  
- **Solution:** Built a reusable `QuantitySelector` widget used across Product Detail and Cart screens, simplifying state management and UX.
